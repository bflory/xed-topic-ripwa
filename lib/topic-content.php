	[lead]We can chart the trajectory of our adult lives by the momentous occasions that alter its course: marriage, the birth of our children, moving into a new house and, of course, retirement.[/lead]

While all of these events indicate times of incredible change, there is one factor that sets retirement apart from those other life events: you might not be surrounded by family and friends ready to chip in and help out when your retirement day comes. Consequently, if you want to enjoy all the amazing new places retirement can take you, you should develop a retirement plan that plays to your specific needs, desires and abilities, so you can generate the income you need even without your old salary.

When you retire, the paycheck you have received for the last 40 years will be gone, which means it will be time to turn your carefully saved and invested assets into a lifetime supply of income. Launching the retirement you want often requires finding a place to harbor your retirement assets that can help provide them with both preservation and growth potential.

But how is that done, exactly?

The first step may require completely redefining your relationship with your finances in three main areas:
<ul>
	<li>Managing your lifestyle change</li>
	<li>Defining your attitude about investment risk</li>
	<li>Understanding how your savings will be affected</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Managing Your Lifestyle Change</strong></h3>
One of the most challenging aspects of retirement can often be the mental gymnastics it requires: you have to stop thinking in terms of the best way to <em><strong>save</strong></em> money and start thinking about the best way to <em><strong>spend</strong></em> it. While it’s true that you can’t have one without the other, the hallmark of a successful retirement is how well you are able to leverage and distribute your assets, not how well you save them.
<blockquote>The hallmark of a successful retirement is how well you are able to leverage and distribute your assets, not how well you save them</blockquote>
In other words, to help ensure that your income needs will be satisfied on day one of your retirement, your retirement plan needs to focus on the distribution of your assets.

You may have a vision of what you think your retirement will be like. Perhaps you want to spend more time with your family, travel or learn a new hobby. Maybe you even created a retirement plan with these visions in mind, but you never really know what life has in store for you. Resultantly, the plans you make need to be capable of adapting to the changing reality of your retirement. It’s crucial that you try to structure your assets in ways that can help them grow and generate the income you need, while still remaining flexible enough to address the unexpected.

No matter where you are in your retirement journey, it’s wise to examine your lifestyle to see how well it matches your expectations of it. Making a readjustment may not be easy, but when you work with a trusted retirement professional, you can be confident that you modify it in a way that is as attuned with, and as beneficial to, your needs as possible.
<h3><strong>Defining Your Attitude About Risk</strong></h3>
When you were in your thirties and forties, it was probably easier to have a more cavalier attitude about what the stock market was doing.

Why?

Because you had two key elements on your side:
<ul>
	<li>Time</li>
	<li>Steady income from employment</li>
</ul>
With these two factors combined, it made it much easier for you to ride out the ups and downs of the market because you had time on your side and could afford to wait for it to recover. In other words, you didn’t need to rely on those investments for income.

Once you retire, however, you won’t have that luxury. If the market suddenly drops by 20 percent, you can’t just wait for the economy to bounce back. Instead, you might have to learn how to live on 20 percent less income. To make matters worse, you won’t have a working income that you can rely on to help get your savings back on track.

When you were working, you were probably your most profitable asset. But once you retire, you are no longer an income-producing asset, which means your attitude about money may need to change because your other assets may become too important to leave to chance.
<h3><strong>Understanding How Your Savings Will Be Affected</strong></h3>
For much of your adult life, it’s likely you became accustomed to getting a paycheck twice a month and paying your bills once a month. This constant and structured flow of money is probably second nature to you.

But retirement changes all the rules. Once you retire, you may have your Social Security benefit and pension to rely on but, other than that, any additional income you require may need to be created by you. You can either try to create a new stream of structured income or try to manage the existing income on your own.

Creating income from a lump sum of money can be more complicated than it appears. Every year, your account undergoes changes:
<ul>
	<li>The market has gone up or down</li>
	<li>Interest has been credited</li>
</ul>
To make things even more complicated, it’s not just the amount of money you <em><strong>have</strong></em> that may change unpredictably, but also the amount of money you <em><strong>need</strong></em>. How much money you’ll need to withdraw each year to maintain your standard of living is about more than just taking care of your expenses, you will also need to factor in the effects of taxes and inflation.

Ultimately, once you retire there is one thing you can most always rely on: you will still need income every year, regardless of whether the market is up or down. Unfortunately, in a down market, those systematic withdrawals will exhaust your savings more quickly.

As you can see, improvising income in retirement can quickly become a difficult task. An easy way to avoid this stress is by organizing your assets in a way that helps create structured and regular sources of income that can last for the rest of your life.

The question, of course, is how?

You need a financial strategy that has the potential to:
<ul>
	<li>Create a self-managing and perpetual income stream,</li>
	<li>Outpace inflation and help give you the growth you need, and</li>
	<li>Provide protection against market risk.</li>
</ul>
The answer is a FIXED INDEX ANNUITY.*

Fixed index annuities are products that were created by insurance companies to specifically address retirees’ needs for growth and a structured, lifetime income, which make fixed index annuities uniquely suited to be a key player in retirement plans.
<h3><strong>Growth</strong></h3>
Indexed annuities are like other annuities, but instead of growing by an interest rate that is declared by an insurance company, they are linked to the performance of a market index. As opposed to a variable annuity** that can go up or down in value and doesn’t protect your principal, an indexed annuity has built-in safeguards that help ensure both your principal and past gains remain protected.

In addition, fixed index annuities are sometimes accompanied by fees that would be deducted from your account, but they are usually not as significant as variable annuities’ fees.  Variable annuities typically include fees you have to pay even if your account value goes down. The fees and charges associated with a variable annuity can sometimes exceed 4% per year, which means that, each and every year, your annuity would need to grow by 4% just to break even.

Although the performance of a variable annuity and a fixed index annuity are both linked to a market index, it’s important to be aware of the differences between the two and to take care to select the annuity that is best suited to meet your needs.

Variable annuities have:
<ul>
	<li>Greater accumulation potential</li>
	<li>More risk exposure</li>
</ul>
Fixed index annuities:
<ul>
	<li>Some accumulation potential</li>
	<li>Less risk exposure</li>
</ul>
When you’re trying to decide if an annuity is right for you, or which an annuity is right for you, it’s important to think about what its purpose within your plan would be. Do you need it for:
<ul>
	<li>Income?</li>
	<li>Accumulation?</li>
	<li>Preservation?</li>
</ul>
Your answers to these questions will help you decide which kind of annuity is right for you.
<h3><strong>Structured, Lifetime Income</strong></h3>
Financial tools are designed to do specific things. For example, life insurance pays a lump sum amount to beneficiaries. Checking accounts are used to pay bills and manage short-term cash. Health insurance helps to offset the cost of medical bills.

Fixed index annuities are specifically designed to create income – either today or at some point in the future. When you place a lump sum into a fixed index annuity, the plan can be custom designed to help provide you with the ongoing income you need, for as long as you need it.

What’s more is that these products can be structured so that they don’t just generate income for a few years – Many fixed index annuities offer additional features called riders that you can purchase.  One rider that may be available is an income rider that will create an income stream that is contractually obligated to last the rest of your life.

A fixed index annuity may be an invaluable component of your retirement plan, helping you to safeguard your assets and your future. In order to help ensure you purchase the fixed index annuity best suited to your needs, it’s important you understand its underlying concepts.
<h3><strong>Indexing</strong></h3>
As I mentioned earlier, a fixed index annuity is an insurance contract linked to a common market index, such as the S&amp;P 500.*** If the index experiences a gain, you and the insurance company are both entitled to a share of the earnings. If the index suffers a loss, depending on the fixed index annuity that you are invested in, typically the insurance company will absorb it but your account value will not decrease.

In other words, fixed index annuities may provide an opportunity to potentially earn more interest than other safe money alternatives because they participate with a market index, but will still help you be insulated against market losses.
<h3><strong>Annual Reset</strong></h3>
One type of fixed index annuity utilizes a concept known as annual reset, which offsets the risk that comes from investing in a fluctuating market onto the insurance company. Essentially, this strategy allows interest earned to be “locked in” annually, with the index value “resetting” at the end of each year, which means that future decreases in the stock market may not affect the interest already earned.

Annual reset can potentially offer higher credited interest than other methods should the stock market fluctuate. It also increases the policyholder value and allows an index credit to be added to the index account on each anniversary. The anniversary date is the actual day the annuity was purchased.

Once added, the credit is “locked in” and can never be taken away, even if the index performs negatively in the future. The index credit of your initial premium now becomes the guaranteed index account “floor,” which participates in all index crediting moving forward.

This new amount will participate in future index growth, giving you the advantage of compound. Moreover, the index starting point is reset each year on the anniversary of your policy.

This product is a possible solution if you are looking for a tool that offers the potential of market index participation returns with minimal risk for loss. Essentially, it means your indexed annuity will not have to make up previous losses in order for the annuity to earn additional interest – each contract year the index’s ending value becomes next year’s starting value.
<h3><strong>Income Rider</strong></h3>
A lifetime income benefit rider helps you take lifetime income from your fixed index annuity without losing control of your retirement assets. Income riders typically come at an additional charge and are designed to help provide principal protection, predictability and minimum income guarantees to people who are worried about running out of money in retirement.

When you purchase an annuity, the insurance company will offer you the option to purchase an income rider to the policy, which will provide income in the form of regular withdrawals from your annuity rather than annuitized payments.

An income rider is basically just the amount of money from which the insurance company may pay you an income while you have your money in their annuity. Your income rider is a larger number than what your investment is actually worth and may increase in value over time, potentially providing you with more income.

If you don’t need your fixed index annuity to provide you with income right away, the income rider of a fixed index annuity often has a “roll up” value. Basically, this means that every year that you don’t tap into the income stream created by the income rider, its value will increase by a set amount and this increase will continue, regardless of the market’s performance, until you trigger the income rider and begin receiving payments from it.

When you purchase a fixed index annuity with this type of feature, you can be reasonably sure that your income needs will be met, and possibly surpassed, even in an uncertain economy or volatile market.

In other words, if you purchase an income rider, the money you receive from your annuity as income will come from your income account, not from your annuity account, which is where your principal is invested. Having these two separate accounts makes it easier to monitor your income account balance, so you can start or stop receiving payments from your income rider at any time.

Here is an example of how a fixed index annuity with an income rider could work:

Latisha Opperman is 63 years old. She has $100,000 to invest and needs this investment to be profitable enough to provide her with income in 10 years. By placing the money in an annuity contract with a 7 percent income rider, the terms of Latisha’s contract dictate that she should have $196,716 in her income account by the time she turns 73, provided that she doesn’t take any distributions during that 10 year period. According to this plan, at age 73, Latisha would be guaranteed an annual income of $11,803 for as long as she lives, assuming a 6 percent payout factor.

Ultimately, fixed index income annuities are versatile financial tools that can provide you with the income and growth potential you need during retirement, without exposing you to undue risk.

Regardless of how you get to retirement or what your goals are, one thing is clear; it can be disastrous if you manage your finances in retirement the same way you managed your money during your working years. Also, retirement strategies are much different today than they were in the past. The economy is completely different. People are living longer, and the tools available to you are more advanced.

Today, you can manage your lifestyle, avoid market volatility and potentially create a lifetime income simply by having a conversation with your retirement professional. Fixed index income annuities can address each of the changes that retirement brings and can help you financially survive, even thrive, during your retirement – and enjoy the retirement you have been working your entire life for!
